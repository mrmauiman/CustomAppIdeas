# Proposal 
Companies often have small inhouse tournaments for games as a way to relieve stress amoung employees.  A lot of the time these tournaments are tracked on a white board in the office.  The purpose of a tournament app would be to automate this tracking where even people outside the office can see.  hireups in a office would be allowed to create tournaments with a signup period.   During this period any employee would be able to sign up for the tournament.  Afterwards the app would auto generate an unbiased tournament bracket.  Which could track the progress of the tournaments.

## Pages
### Tournaments Home Page
There would have to be as tournaments home page which would display the currently running tournaments, the tournaments in the sign up period, and the tournaments the user is currently participating in.  There would also need to be a buttton only visible by users with a tournament creator role to create new tournaments.  Tournaments in sign-up period would have a sign up button to sign up.

### Create Tournament Page
There would have to be a form for creating tournaments with the following fields:
- Name
- Game
- Color scheme
- Sign-up open date
- Start date
- limit who can join checkbox
	- roles that can join
	- users that can join

### View Tournament Page
There would have to be a page to view the bracket and see who is playing against who.  This page would also be used by the tournament administrator to mark who won what rounds.  administrators would also be able to cancel tournaments from this page.

## Other Functionality
### Notifications
The app would notify users when their opponent for a round is decided.  It woulds also notify all the players at the end of the tournament who won.

### Winner Rewards
The app should also have someway to reward the winners of tournaments.  This could be a hale of fame page or something else.
