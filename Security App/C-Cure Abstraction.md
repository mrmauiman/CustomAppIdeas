# C-Cure Abstraction
C-Cure is an application that manages employee access, alarms, and devices (doors, cameras, etc.).

## Functionality
### Employee Access
There should be functionality to manager badge access for all employees.  This access should be tied to a user and not the badge, so that disableing a lost badge is as simple as untieing it from the employee.

### Alarms
The application should be able to handle alarms by notifying the necessary people.

### Devices
The application should give the ability to operate devices remotely.
